Portable *GNU/Emacs*[fn:1] dotfiles. Built for Life, Liberty, and the Open Road.

+ 100% Reproducible
+ 100% Immutable
+ 100% Literate

* Setup
# :PROPERTIES:
# :header-args: :tangle early-init.el
# :END:

These is my personal configuration(s) for *GNU/Linux*[fn:2], and *GNU/Emacs*[fn:1] software. It enables a consistent experience and computing environment across all of my machines. The entire experience is controlled with *GNU/Emacs*[fn:1], leveraging it's capabilities for *Literate Programming*[fn:3]. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; This file is controlled by README.org
;; Please make any modifications there.
#+end_src

* Config
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle init.el
:END:

Once the early-init phase as completed, there are only two remaining tasks to complete before the system is fully initialized.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; This file is controlled by README.org
;; Please make any modifications there.
#+end_src

The first task involves loading a machine-specific (host) configuration file. This gives the oppertunity for a host to intervene in the module loading process, adding or removing modules before the next stage has begun. This is accomplished by modifying the list of modules in ~dotfiles/modules~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Load the host configuration.
(dotfiles/load-host system-name)
#+end_src

After the host configuration file has loaded, the value of ~dotfiles/modules~ is used to load all of the enabled modules. They're loaded in sequential order, and an error in any module will end this process.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Load the enabled modules.
(dotfiles/load-modules dotfiles/modules)
#+end_src
