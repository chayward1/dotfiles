* Upgrading from Org Roam v1 to v2

Yesterday, I began the process of migrating from Org Roam v1 to v2. This is a huge breaking change. I use the mentioned software /everywhere/ in my [[id:e4ad3dd5-0996-45bc-92ab-6bdbf16e4310][Dotfiles]], and keeping up with the newest features is important to me.

I read a lot of complains online about the changes. Most of them seem to be around the fact that because this deprecates support for file links, this is a step-backwards in terms of compatibility with other Org packages.
